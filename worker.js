   Venue dashboard - Worker shell (ships in the FC Member Dashboard Kit)

   You are the AI running this build. This file is YOURS to finish; the owner
   never sees it. The shell already does the hard plumbing:

     - serves the dashboard page
     - a metrics API with a fixed contract the page already understands
     - an OAuth2 begin/callback flow with token storage
     - automatic access-token refresh, INCLUDING rotating refresh tokens
       (Xero rotates the refresh token on every refresh - the store persists
       the new one every time; never cache tokens outside the store)
     - plain-English connection status for the Connections screen
     - the no-API rungs built in: POST /api/ingest (file/export data in),
       an email() handler stub for emailed reports, a scheduled() cron hook,
       and a KV day-store the export-fed adapters read from

   What you fill in: the three ADAPTERS (accounting / pos / rostering), each
   marked with  >>> ADAPTER ...  blocks. Wire them against the provider's
   CURRENT documentation, per capability-matrix.md and playbook.md.

   Rules that bind every adapter (kpi-spec.md is the law):
     - accounting supplies EVERY money figure, always ex GST/sales tax
     - pos supplies ONE number: completed transaction count (no voids/refunds)
     - rostering supplies rostered cost only (projected wage %)
     - read-only scopes/permissions everywhere
     - secrets ONLY via Worker secrets (wrangler secret put NAME) - never in
       this file, never in the repo, never echoed to the owner

   Bindings expected (wrangler.toml): TOKENS (KV). Secrets: see each adapter.

/* OPTIONAL no-API hooks any adapter may add (the fallback-ladder rungs):
     mode: 'export'           - source is fed by exports, not a live API
     parseExport(env, h, raw) - raw = { text, contentType }: parse the tool's
                                exported CSV/report into day rows:
                                  pos:        [{ date:'YYYY-MM-DD', count }]
                                  accounting: [{ date, revenue, cogs, wagesSuper, overheads }]
                                  rostering:  [{ date, cost }]
                                Adding parseExport makes the dashboard's
                                Connections screen offer a file-upload panel
                                for this source (the guided-upload rung).
     scheduledPull(env, h)    - cron hook (uncomment [triggers] in
                                wrangler.toml): fetch the tool's own export
                                (its report scheduler's output, a saved export
                                URL) and h.saveIngestedRows(rows).
   In export mode, implement fetchRange/fetchMonthly via h.readIngested /
   h.monthlyIngested instead of provider calls. Emailed reports: complete the
   email() handler at the bottom (needs the owner's domain on their Cloudflare
   with Email Routing pointed at this Worker). Ingest auth: the INGEST_TOKEN
   secret; if the owner uploads by hand, that same value is their upload code. */
